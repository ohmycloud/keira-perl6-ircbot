What
====

A Perl 6+5 bot using the IRC::Client Perl 6 module

Description
===========

This is an IRC bot in Perl 5 and 6. It was originally only in Perl 5 but the core has now been rewriten in Perl 6, and the rest is being ported over now.

Text Substitution
-----------------

s/before/after/gi functionality. Use g or i at the end to make it global or case insensitive

If the last character is a slash, we assume any slashes in the $after term are literal ( Except for the last one ) If not, then anything after the last slash is a specifier

Mentioned
---------

Gets the last time the specified person mentioned any users the bot knows about.

`Usage: !mentioned nickname`

Time
----

Gets the current time in the specified location. Uses Google to do the lookups.

`Usage !time Location`

Perl 6 Eval
-----------

Evaluates the requested Perl 6 code and returns the output of standard out and error messages.

`Usage: !p6 my $var = "Hello Perl 6 World!"; say $var`

Perl 5 Eval
-----------

Evaluates the requested Perl 5 code and returns the output of standard out and error messages.

`Usage: !p my $var = "Hello Perl 5 World!\n"; print $var`

When converting from numerical each value that is a different number is
delimited by spaces.  Examples are below.

Output: `üêßABCD`

Is the reverse of the `!u` command.
